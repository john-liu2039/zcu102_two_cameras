2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer

CLKC-26#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with BUF_IN drives sequential IO with CLKOUT0  
The MMCME4 cell design_1_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst has COMPENSATION value BUF_IN, but CLKOUT0 output drives sequential cells directly connected to ports. In order to achieve insertion delay and phase-alignment for the sequential cells directly connected to ports, a COMPENSATION of ZHOLD must be used. (The problem cell is sensor1_iic_sda_iobuf/IBUFCTRL_INST (in sensor1_iic_sda_iobuf macro).)
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-30#1 Advisory
MMCME4 not driven by IO has BUFG in feedback loop  
The MMCME4 cell design_1_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst has a BUFGCE design_1_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clkf_buf clock buffer in the feedback loop, but the clock input is not directly driven by an I/O to create a Zero Delay Buffer Clock (a common use for having a buffer in the feedback loop). If there is no specific need for this buffer in the feedback loop (e.g. no timing paths between CLKINx/CLKOUTx domains or low latency requirement), then it is suggested to remove that BUFG* from the feedback path. This will allow for a lower power solution and free the clock resource for other purposes.
